2. User Hierarchy & Ecosystem
</p>

<p>
Here’s how your ecosystem aligns conceptually:
</p>

<p>
Level	Entity	Description
Top-Level	Admin Tenant	The USDA-level or managing organization that governs configuration, policies, and multi-tenant onboarding.
Tenant	Agency, Program, or Partner Organization (e.g., FPAC, NRCS, AMS, University Extension Office)
User	Individual working within one or more tenants (Farmer, Surveyor, Partner Staff, USDA Employee, etc.)
Role	Permission bundle defining what a user can do within that tenant (Admin, Data Entry, Reviewer, Viewer, etc.)
</p>

<p>
3. User Types (Personas)
</p>

Below is a classification of core user types your system will likely manage, all represented in the same user entity but distinguished by roles and tenant association.

<p>
User Type	Typical Tenant	Purpose / Responsibilities	Example Roles
</p>
<p>
USDA System Administrator	Admin Tenant (USDA HQ)	Manages all tenants, roles, and platform settings.	SYSTEM_ADMIN, TENANT_MANAGER
USDA Program Manager / Employee	USDA Program Tenant (e.g., NRCS, FPAC)	Oversees survey planning, allocates resources, monitors data quality.	PROGRAM_MANAGER, SURVEY_REVIEWER
Surveyor / Field Agent	USDA or Partner Tenant	Collects field-level or farmer-level data using the Survey Portal UI or mobile app.	SURVEYOR, FIELD_AGENT
Partner Organization Staff	Partner Tenant (e.g., University Extension, NGO)	Supports USDA surveys, assists farmers, or validates data.	PARTNER_USER, DATA_STEWARD
Farmer / Producer (Customer)	Tenant representing farm / co-op region	Provides self-reported data for surveys or validations.	FARMER, RESPONDENT

<p>
Technical Representation (for your APIs)
Entity	Key Fields	Notes
User	id, username, email, tenantCode, roles[], type, status	Common table for all users
Tenant	id, code, name, contactEmail, settings	Links to many users
Role	id, label, permissions[]	Assignable across tenants
User-Tenant-Role mapping	user_id, tenant_code, role_id	Defines context (if multi-tenant support needed)
</p>

<p>
Role Granularity Suggestion
</p>
<p>
Category	Role Name	Capability Highlights
Platform	SYSTEM_ADMIN	Manage tenants, roles, global settings
Tenant	TENANT_ADMIN	Manage users & roles within tenant
Survey Lifecycle	SURVEY_MANAGER, SURVEYOR, DATA_REVIEWER	Create, collect, and validate surveys
